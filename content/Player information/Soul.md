Every living being inherently has a soul, Souls can be blessed by their god of worship to grant certain powers.

All undead beings do not have a soul.

Losing your soul will ether kill you or turn you into undead.

The power a soul can hold is determined at birth randomly or artificially changed through powerful relics
