Empire of Armanti: -The main story will be here
The Youngest power to appear in history. 

A small county surrounded by ever changing powers, young Armanti was fed up with every other god trying to take his peoples souls for sacrifice in their pursuit of power. As he was one of the only followers of the church of light at the time, he gathered many unfortunate people under his banner and grew. 

They came to be after a small nation state was able to ally itself with many other small states and conquer the surrounding lands, spreading the god of lights teachings to more and more people, trying to drive out the old ways. 

He succeeded in unifying all of the surrounding lands under his banner but many dark groups still lurk to regain control of the land. 

Population made up of about 60% humans and 40% others. As long as you can follow rules prove your worth the people don't care who you are.
