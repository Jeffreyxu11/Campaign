An unexplored land that sits on the border of Armanti and Telaya. Everyone has heard tales of this forest, when someone goes in, you may never see them again. Armanti tried to map out the forest, but after losing a large squad, even Armanti chose to leave it alone during his rule. Leaving anyone who wanted to explore it with a warning: ==Don't look at the trees.==

Devil's Colosseum got its name from the few that managed to make it out sane. They describe the place as =="Trees thick enough you think they were walls in front of you, locking you in with whatever is in there."== There are a few towns and cities nearby that chop down a few trees a day trying to keep it in check as it grows abnormally fast and the logs they chop shrivel up after a few days. A few people have described it as voices in their heads, some have claimed that it lures you in and steals your life to plant a new tree. Some claim the forest to ==watch from all angles== while a ==large serpent sweeps you away== while you are confused.
