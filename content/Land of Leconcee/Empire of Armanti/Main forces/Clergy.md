The Church holds the most authority in the empire as the old king Armanti was a Paladin of the church. 

75% of all beings in Armanti worship the God of Light

The rest of the population warship ether a mix of the main god and some secondary god or an eldritch god.

Other powers may worship other gods.

All worshippers gain power from worshipping albeit a little, while paladins and clerics who fully embrace the religion and gain massive blessings from the god.

Anyone can become part of the church and go through trials to try to become a true paladin or cleric.
If one is chosen to be trained as a cleric or paladin, they are sent out in the world after training for a year to accumulate good deeds and faith to be judged back at the temple. If they have accumulated enough, they are promoted.

Church members are given high status in Armanti.

All followers of gods gain power by performing deeds that fit the gods theme. Example: helping a stranger or stopping an attack could grant you more powers. While killing someone as painful as possible may grant powers for a certain eldritch god.

Gods can have multiple ways for offerings, some ways more gray then others. The gods don't care how you give offerings, only that its in the rules and you do.
