Odison is where Dwarfs, gnomes, halflings, Giants, and many monstrous races originate from. Not a set country, more like a wild area filled with beasts, valuable resources, and free land. 
It is a land mass surrounded by mountains. Many of the lands resources have been untapped but venturing in is extremely dangerous.

Currently the Republic of Telaya is at war with Armanti over land and Resource ownership of this land and Telaya wants a land route though Armanti so they dont have to sail across and back. 

Dwarfs and more sociable races live at Soraks Range. Those that leave, usually make the trip to Fort Mills.
